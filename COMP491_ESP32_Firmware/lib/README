This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries.
PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link into executable file.

The source code of each library should be placed in a an own separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/[here are source files]").

For example, see a structure of the following two libraries `Foo` and `Bar`:

|--lib
|  |
|  |--Bar
|  |  |--docs
|  |  |--examples
|  |  |--src
|  |     |- Bar.c
|  |     |- Bar.h
|  |  |- library.json (optional, custom build options, etc) https://docs.platformio.org/page/librarymanager/config.html
|  |
|  |--Foo
|  |  |- Foo.c
|  |  |- Foo.h
|  |
|  |- README --> THIS FILE
|
|- platformio.ini
|--src
   |- main.c

and a contents of `src/main.c`:
```
#include <Foo.h>
#include <Bar.h>

int main (void)
{
  ...
}

```

PlatformIO Library Dependency Finder will find automatically dependent
libraries scanning project source files.

In the context of an ESP32-based Digital Readout (DRO) system, a tachometer and probe can significantly expand the system's capabilities, particularly for precision machining, tool monitoring, and workshop applications. Here's how each component could be used:

### Tachometer

A tachometer is a device used to measure the rotation speed of an object, typically in revolutions per minute (RPM). In a DRO system, which is often used alongside machines like lathes, milling machines, or drills, integrating a tachometer can provide valuable feedback about the speed of the machine's spindle or workpiece. This information is crucial for:

- **Speed Control:** Ensuring that the machine operates at the correct speed for the material being worked on and the specific operation being performed (cutting, drilling, etc.), optimizing tool life and workpiece quality.
- **Process Optimization:** By monitoring the spindle speed, users can make adjustments to achieve better surface finishes, reduce tool wear, and prevent overheating of the workpiece or tool.
- **Safety:** Monitoring the machine's speed to prevent operating beyond the safe limits of the tool or material.

### Probe

A probe in a DRO system is typically a touch probe used for workpiece positioning and measurement. It can automatically detect the location of a workpiece on the machine table by touching and thereby closing an electrical circuit. This allows for:

- **Automated Setup:** Quickly and accurately setting the workpiece origin or finding reference points without manual measurement, significantly reducing setup time.
- **Dimensional Measurement:** Checking the dimensions of a workpiece without removing it from the machine, allowing for in-process verification and adjustments.
- **Feature Location:** Identifying and setting up machining operations relative to existing features on the workpiece, such as holes, edges, or corners.

### Integration with ESP32 DRO

When integrated into an ESP32 DRO system:

- **Data Display and Logging:** The ESP32 can process inputs from both the tachometer and the probe, display this information on the DRO interface, and log data for quality control and process optimization.
- **Feedback Loop:** Information from the tachometer and probe can be used to create a feedback loop for automated control systems, adjusting machine parameters in real-time for optimal performance.
- **Wireless Connectivity:** The ESP32's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities allow for remote monitoring and control, enabling the operator to receive updates on machine status, make adjustments from a distance, or integrate with other smart workshop systems.

Integrating a tachometer and probe into an ESP32 DRO system thus enhances its functionality, making it a more powerful tool for precision machining, workshop automation, and quality control in manufacturing processes.
